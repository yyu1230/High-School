GREEK DEITIES GENETIC RISKS
-- Capstone Greek and Roman History Unit Project
Author: Yongqing Grace Yu
Last updated 11 November 2021

* RESEARCH QUESTION
  - How do genetic illnesses pass down the incestuous Greek mythological family
    tree in Hesiod's Theogony? Specifically, if one or more primordial deities
    are genetically defective, how much genetic risks would their posterities
    suffer?

* PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
  - To calculate the expected genetic composition of 310 Greek gods/mortals
    based on user-designated primordial god/mortal genotypes;
  - To provide contextual interpretations of these data, such as on the
    expressed phenotype and genetic legacy of different genotype probability
    distributions, in order to provide a satisfactory answer to the research
    question for a general audience;
  - To spur an interest in and enhance the understanding of Greek mythological
    figures for the reader;
  - To spur an interest in and enhance the understanding of evolutionary biology
    for the reader;
  - To discourage the reader from marrying their relatives.

* INVENTED ABBREVIATIONS
  - deity (plural, deities): refers to all mythological figures, both gods and
    mortals, in the Theogony family tree
  - primor (plural, primors): "deities" whose parents are not included in the
    family tree, i.e., primordial gods + mortals of ungodly descent (highlighted
    yellow in spreadsheet; genotype designated directly by user)
  - posterity (plural, posterities): all non-"primor" figures in the family tree

* PROGRAM PROCEDURES
  - You will be prompted to designate a value for the genotype (nn, nd, or dd;
    where n designates the normal allele and d the defective) of the concerned
    genetic character for each "primor."
  - You can then enter the names of any "deities" (there will be a list), and
    the program will return their probabilities of having genotypes nn, nd, and
    dd, and interpret these results in the contexts of the genetic illness being
    autosomal recessive, dominant, co-dominant, or incompletely dominant.
  - Finally, when you enter "quit," the program will exit with thoughtful advice
    (you are welcome!) on why it is not a good idea to marry your relatives.

* NOTES ON "DEITIES"
  - Primordial gods: Chaos, Gaea, Tartaros, Eros
  - Mortals of ungodly descent:
    + Cadmus (founder of Thebes, Harmonia's lover, Semele's father),
    + Alkmene (Zeus' lover, Heracles' mother),
    + Iasion (hero, Demeter's husband),
    + Tithonus (Eos' lover, Mnemnon/Emathion's father),
    + Jason (hero of the Golden Fleece, Medea's husband),
    + Asopus (actually river god of unknown descent, Metope's husband,
              Aegina's father, Aiakos' maternal grandfather),
    + Metope's mother (Ladon's lover),
    + Endeïs (Aiakos' wife, Peleus' mother, Achilles' paternal grandmother),
    + Anchises (Trojan nobleman, Aphrodite's lover, Aineias' father),
    + Odysseus (hero of the Odyssey and the Trojan War)
  - Total "deities": 310, see "Notes on the Pedigree Spreadsheet"
  - When you enter the names of "deities," please use the same spelling as in
    the linked Excel spreadsheet (e.g., Heracles instead of Hercules).
    Unfortunately, the author is not sufficiently competent to make the program
    understand the nuances of spelling when she hardly understands Greek-Latin
    translation herself.

* NOTES ON THE PEDIGREE SPREADSHEET
  - I made the Excel spreadsheet based on Zaffron Steam's YouTube video (see
    "Sources/References") and Wikipedia/Britannica where Zaffron Steam's record
    is incomplete. The spreadsheet details
    + "deities" in the family tree
    + their biological parents (identical entries if born parthenogenetically)
    + their gender
    + their personification/role(s)
    + possible controversies
    + additional notes
  - The complete Excel spreadsheet is accessible on GitHub:
    https://github.com/yyu1230/Miscellaneous/blob/main/greek_deities_genetic_
    risks/greek_deities_pedigree.xlsx

* NOTES ON THE COMPUTER PROGRAM
  - The program is written in Python (specifically, Python 3), so you may have
    to download it before the program can run successfully. Alternatively, you
    can find an online Python compiler (interpreter).
  - The program imports the xlrd module to read Excel files, so you may have to
    "pip install xlrd" (or "pip3 install xlrd") on your machine before the
    program can run successfully. Alternatively, you can find an online Python
    compiler (interpreter) that supports xlrd.
  - As I coded the program, I took advantage of the fact that parents always
    appear before their children in the spreadsheet. In other situations,
    recursion has to be applied.

* ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
  - As I designed the algorithm, it occurred to me to question whether these
    probabilities could be adjusted to become metrics for extent of inbreeding
    within a population. When I searched online, I found that "coefficient of
    relationship" measures just that. Perhaps it would be interesting to include
    this indicator in future expansions of the project (if any), as it provides
    insights into which individuals in the family tree are most affected by the
    incestuous practice.
  - Another potential update in future expansions (if any) could be to calculate
    "how much" of each "primor" is in the pedigree (i.e., relative fitness but
    across all generations, since gods don't die; being another deity's parent
    +1/2, parthenogenetic double parent +1, grandparent +1/4, etc.). This
    information could be useful in calculating the coefficient of relationship
    for each "deity" as well as predicting the future gene pool. Plus, wouldn't
    it be fascinating to find out which "deities" are the most reproductively
    successful?
  - An additional potential update (yep, I continue to think of weird stuff as I
    proofread what I wrote) could be to allow users to enter probabilities
    instead of definite genotypes for the "primors." In fact, this is extremely
    easy to do, and could be useful for other potential updates, but the author
    is just too lazy :P
  - Just noticed that the primordial god Eros, personification of love and
    desire, is the only "primor" to never reproduce. How ironic!

* LIMITATIONS
  - Mutations are not considered because the author of this project is not
    sufficiently adept in biology to fully understand how, why, when, or how
    likely mutations occur.
  - Pleiotropy, polygenetic inheritance, epigenetic inheritance, linked genes,
    or sex-linked genetic illnesses are not considered because their added
    complexity mentally overwhelms the already-exhausted author.
  - This project is heavily based on Zaffron Steam's YouTube video on Hesiod's
    Theogony and Wikipedia content on Greek mythology, neither of which is a
    typical scholarly source. Additionally, even within a specific translation
    of Hesiod's Theogony, there exist errors (made by Hesiod), such as when he
    named 51 Nereids despite claiming earlier that there are only 50, and when
    he attributed the origin of the Moirai to different parents in different
    parts of the book. Any mistake made by any one of Hesiod, his translator,
    Zaffron Steam, Wikipedia, or the author of this project could result in
    inaccuracies in the program results.
  - There are monsters in the family tree... Perhaps it would be interesting to
    investigate which arrangement(s) of genetic illnesses would provide closest
    results to these anomalies. However, the author is too preoccupied with
    other urgent/important matters such as college applications to further delve
    into the matter, so this will be left as an exercise for the reader (JK).

* ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
  - I would like to thank my Capstone Greek and Roman History instructor Mr.
    Westbay for providing me with vital resources such as the digital copy of
    the Theogony, for referring me to Zaffron Steam's exhaustive lecture on the
    deity family tree, and for his enlightening lectures on Greek mythologies.
    His emotional support for my quirky proposal was also invaluable in my
    research process.
  - I would like to thank my Honors Biology instructor Mr. Lotus for his
    exceptional lectures in biological inheritance which laid the foundation for
    my research. In the past, he had also encouraged me to combine my interests
    in mathematics and computer science with biology, which is exactly what I
    did in this project.
  - I would like to thank the security guard of our local library who provided
    me with a face mask when I forgot to bring one. He had done so not out of
    professional or moral obligation but out of kindness and concern. Without
    his help, I would not have been able to enter the library and thus would not
    have had as peaceful a working environment, which could impact the quality
    of this work.
  - I would like to thank my parents for not committing filicide when they
    learned that their daughter had spent an entire weekend studying the sexual
    encounters of Greek mythological figures instead of working on her college
    essays as she should. Ultimately, it had been their magnanimity that enabled
    me to complete this project. (JK.)
  - Finally, I would like to thank you, the reader, for not reporting me when it
    became apparent that I, an underage teenager, have accessed content that are
    possibly classified as adult-only since it concerns the incestuous sexual
    relationships of people and gods. Additionally, as an Animalia Chordata
    Mammalia Primates Haplorhini Simiiformes Hominidae Homininae Hominini Homo
    Sapien (i.e., human being), I apologize for any mistakes I may have made and
    of which I am not currently aware. In the event that you notice any such
    errors, please let me know!

What does this mean?
Having alleles "nn" means that
  - the deity *expresses healthy traits* in the genetic character concerned;
  - the deity *passes down a healthy allele* to each of his/her children.
    If the deity's sexual partner also has alleles "nn,"
    then all of their children will be healthy with alleles "nn."
Having alleles "dd" means that
  - the deity *expresses defective traits* in the genetic character concerned;
  - the deity *passes down a defective allele* to each of his/her children.
    If the deity's sexual partner also has alleles "dd,"
    then all of their children will be defective with alleles "dd."
Having alleles "nd" means that
  - the deity *passes down a healthy or defective allele* to each of his/her
    children with equal probability;
  - if the genetic illness in question is *autosomal recessive*, then the deity
    *expresses healthy traits* in the genetic character concerned;
  - if the genetic illness in question is *autosomal dominant*, then the deity
    *expresses defective traits* in the genetic character concerned;
  - if the genetic illness in question is *autosomal codominant*, then the deity
    *expresses both healthy and defective traits* in the genetic character
    concerned (e.g., sickle cell disease);
  - if the genetic illness in question is *autosomal incompletely dominant*,
    then the deity *expresses in-between healthy and defective traits* in the
    genetic character concerned (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease).

### THOUGHTFUL NOTE

print('''

Here comes the much-anticipated thoughtful note advising the reader why they
should not to marry their relatives! ;)

Running the program a few times, you may notice that percentage of defective
alleles in the gene pool does not change over generations of incest -- from
that, it is tempting to conclude that perhaps inbreeding is not so bad after
all!

But wait! Examining the percentage of "dd" genotypes in the population, you will
see that it increases significantly over generations -- this is the primary
reason why inbreeding is bad. Most genetic illnesses are autosomal recessive,
so defective traits are only expressed in individuals with "dd" genotypes, and
children can only have "dd" if both parents have defective alleles -- much more
likely in relatives, who share similar genes, than in unrelated couples.

You may be thinking... "But I don't have any genetic diseases and nor do my
siblings! Does that mean it would be fine for us to marry?"
Nope! Although you don't have any *expressed* genetic defects, you are probably
a carrier of various defective alleles. For relatives, these "hidden defects"
tend to occur in similar places, so when they combine, oh no! Your children may
get genotype "dd" and *express* defects for some genetic characters. However,
for unrelated couples, "hidden defects" tend to occur in different places, so
when their genes combine, offsprings are likely to inherit mostly "nn" or "nd"
genotypes, thus not *expressing* any genetic diseases. Hoorah!

Moral of the story? Don't marry your relatives! In fact, you probably cannot
legally do that anyway!
